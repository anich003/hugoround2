1. Pay my digital ocean bills (oops)
2. Set up github repository
3. Use DigitalOcean App feature to link up to GitHub repo
4. Set up domain as `round2.anich003.me` (let DigitalOcean manage domain & nameservers)

### Notes
This was technically easy mode deployment since I didn't have to fuss with building the site locally and uploading files to a machine that is hosting a webserver. One thing to try next is to actually go through the steps of provisionining a machine, setting up a websever (nginx), and uploading the built files. For another time!
